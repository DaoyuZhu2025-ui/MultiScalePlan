# Multi-Scale Perception in Behavior Planning Using Computational Models

## Overview

Perception across multiple scales plays a pivotal role in understanding complex environments and dynamic behaviors. Traditional computational models often struggle to integrate fine-grained local details with broader contextual information, leading to limitations in scale adaptability and task generalization.

This repository introduces a novel framework that employs **adaptive multi-scale feature integration** to enhance behavior planning in dynamic and multi-resolution scenarios. By leveraging **hierarchical feature extraction, scale-aware attention mechanisms, and temporal aggregation**, our model dynamically balances fine and coarse information, ensuring robust performance across spatial and temporal domains. 

A **feedback-driven optimization strategy** enables continuous refinement of multi-scale representations, adapting seamlessly to diverse tasks and input variations. 

## Features

- **Hierarchical Feature Extraction**: Captures both fine-grained and global-scale information.
- **Scale-Aware Attention Mechanism**: Enhances the ability to prioritize relevant features at different scales.
- **Temporal Aggregation**: Ensures coherent perception over time for dynamic behavior planning.
- **Feedback-Driven Optimization**: Refines multi-scale representations based on task-specific performance.
- **Generalizable Across Domains**: Effective for various environments, including robotics, autonomous systems, and AI-driven decision-making.
